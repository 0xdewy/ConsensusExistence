# Blockchain Identity


## Abstract
###### This whitepaper outlines a potential platform that could be built to supply internet users with financial incentives to connect with their friends and ease login/verification processes using an Ethereum public-key. The public key acts much like a traditional browser cookie, remaining on the users computer as a stable identifier across browsing sessions. The cookie however, has no practical capabilities in public key cryptography, whereas the Ethereum public key can be used, like a PGP key, to offer the world a secure way to message and share data with you. 
######The public key acts as a code which other nodes can encrypt pieces of data with. We can use this public key to hash data and make it only available to the person who is control of the corresponding private/public key pairs. Using a public key based browser cookie allows us to not only recongize an entity across browser sessions, but it also opens up an opportunity for data verification and let the users reap benefits from their social networks. This will be achieved by creating a market of credibility. Developing encryption protocals such as zero-knowledge-proofs(https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/01/15/privacy-on-the-blockchain/), solves the impossibly transparent nature of the blockchain, and allows users to show information to one another only if they agree to do so. This opens up an opportunity for an innovation in online identity, where a user's data can be proven without being shared, increasing security and privacy. The idea that a user should be in charge of their identity is referred to as [Self-Sovereign-Identity](http://www.coindesk.com/path-self-sovereign-identity/). The eventual implications of such a system, is that the user is put in charge of their identity and the financial aspects of the data that is associated with it. There are two main problems that this platform is designed to solve. How credible is this entity and how do we know the data truly belongs to them? These questions have real world value and we plan to make two incentivized economies: a credibility based economy, and a data based economy. Credibility is defined as the probability that you are a real entity and that you are able to vouch for other entities you know are real. Data is defined as anything you use to tell the world who you are. A user requires credibility to store data, but also requires proof-of-data to gain credibility. Through these mechanisms we hope to build a platform that can supply users with a more simple and secure online verification process. 

## Online Identity in Blockchain world
###### 
## Innovation
######The proliferation of consensus ledgers combined with public key encryption allows us to build identity systems that improve on privacy, security, validity, which brings with it a solution to the trust issues associated with current online identification protocols. Bots,security,privacy etc.......TODO EXPLAIN IMPROVEMENTS IN IDENTITY/VERIFICATION

## Verification vs Identity
######Current approaches to creating a robust and stable online identifier usually involves asking a user to sign in using one of our giant social media networks. Why social media is such a key area in identity and verification is the simple fact that any physical characteristic about you can be copied. Not that physical identifiers are useless in verification, but the things about you that are very difficult to reproduce are your complex relationships and things contained in your head (passwords). Social networks tell the world who you are and who you interact with. There is a growing distrust in giving corporate entities complete control over users' identity. Many people have been careful about not presenting too much information on facebook. Most online companies offer free service in exchange for the financial rights to your data. The main problem with this approach is lack of control on the users part to determine who gets to see what. This combined with the inability to tell who is real and who is a bot, creates a very insecure and messy social network. By utilizing public key cryptography we can move towards an encrypted online reality, that offers permission-based-access to sensitive information. 
The highest levels of verificaiton are handed out by the largest authority, being approved by the national governments. (Doctor verifies birth certificate, ICBC verifies license etc...) To encourage cooperation between blockchain identity platforms, and avoid the frustrations of fragmented digital identity, the platform could allow users to create crowdfunding for smart-contracts to be written, bridging identities between platforms. Thanks to the rapid innovation in encryption technologies, a platform such as this will be able to allow users to choose which entity is allowed to see which data, Having full control over their digital identities, unless the network decides they aren't real, or that a certain piece of data doesn't actualy belong to this node. At the current stage of online identity we have the issue of fragmentation which may be in part to peoples reluctance to give a single identity full financial and personal control over their identity. TODO ORGANIZE + ADD

## Economy of Credibility
###### The economy of credibility operates through financial gambles on another users' identity, creating a proof-of-trust in this person. This gamble will hold a financial reward if the majority of nodes agree with the users' bet, whether it's yes or no. In this way there will be financial incentive to both verify your friends, and find nodes who don't indicate future credibility.  We refer to these users as nodes because each node may be a single entity of any type, such as a corporation, a group of people, or bot in the form of a smart contract. Although much of this platform is designed to reduce bots, I think it may be valuable to allow bots as long as they are properly identified. The thinking here is that people may produce effective bots that are able to help weed out illegitimate nodes.  TODO EXPLAIN MARKET FORCES + EXPLAIN TOKENIZED INCENTIVES

## Data Economy
###### The identity economy is the purchasing and selling of individuals private data. The sale must originate from that user, and they can dictate the price. This will create a free market of data, involving advertisers and users. As crypto currency begins to grow advertisers will be increasingly interested in the spending habits of users, and users will be able to charge the appropriate price. Current models tend to offer a free service and then sell the data that is derived from users using the service. What could develop in the blockchain world is that services will tend to charge micro payments depending on how much of the service you would like to use. ie. Augur, Oraclize, Storj. Advertisers are left with a different landscape. Instead of a central service keeping track of it's users, there are going to be many services that can link activities to a public key (instead of cookie). TODO. 


## Credibility & Data
###### The identity economy will be based around two tokenized-markets. Credibility and Data, which are not necessarily related but require one another. In this system credibility will be how much money your own personal identity market is making, which is defined as the profit margin between people gambling "yes" on the validity of your identity and the people gambling "no" on the validity of your identity. Your data will be everything you use to let the online world know who you are. There may be situations where a node is credible but is claiming anothers persons data to be their own.

## Proof of Data 
######

## Disputes
###### A data dispute will create a market where users actively communicate with both parties and attempt to validate them, through gambling. Three outcomes can come from this. Either node 1 gets claim on data, node 2 gets claim on data, or neither has valid claim on the data which will subsequently erase the data from the network. This is a complex game theory problem that needs to be reviewed intensively. 

## Centralization vs Decentralization
###### It will be vital for a new node on the network to sign up with a very credible node to avoid being gambled against by the network. The smart contracts could be coded, to allow for a multi-sig node that can do direct verification, such as encrypting drivers license numbers, proof of address or any of the typical centralized verification approaches. With token-incentivization, decentralization is an efficient way of delegating power and offers higher security, however, it is a difficult approach when the network is small. Crowdsourced economies work better when the crowd is large (ie. Wikipedia, Stack Exchange). For this reason it may be smart to have a pre-programmed centralized aspect that fades over time, as a way to transition into a fully decentralized identity platform. 

## Cooperation
######We expect many blockchain companies will be built on top of Ethereum, and thus would encourage communication standards between different blockchain companies to help increase fluidity and security of our online lives. Other blockchain social-networks are great assets to our platform and they would inherently profit from the credibility that comes with being a large trusted entity, especially entities involved in verificiation.

## Security 
###### The main problem with running a decentralized service, is the game theory holes that can open up. An obvious weakpoint is the ability for someone to create thousands of nodes and subsequently create a self-reinforcing ring of nodes that all verify eachother. This attack however, would cost a lot of money to start up and would rest on a very fragile foundation. This kind of attack would have to be mitigated by groups of users who are able to discover the collusion, and ultimately see that this friendship-ring is not backed by any primary data (ie. name, email, picture etc..). 

## Lost Passwords
###### If access to the Ethereum wallet is lost, there should be a mechanism to recover. ie. beneficiary, data-proofs, social network? Regardless the node will need a new public-key and all data which was encrypted with the previous public key will need to be taken down and re-encrypted. Otherwise there could be no recovery mechanism and a user could create a new account and dispute the data of his previous account. He should win this dispute, since the old account won't have a good argument, being non respondant. This would result in you and your network gambling "no" on your old node and gaining the consensus rewards, until the node is out of credibility funds and is deleted.
