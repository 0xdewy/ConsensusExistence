# Blockchain Identity


## Abstract
This whitepaper outlines a token-incentivized verification system, that could be built using Ethereum smart contracts and PGP keys. The goal of the platform is to give probabilities that a given user is the entity they claim to be. The platform is designed to incentivize people to prove or disprove the identity of other people on the network. This system will use a token to represent what we refer to as "Credibility". Traditional high-authority forms of verification are done by the local governments and these documents are used to access your most sensitive information/money. The problem with identity is that even these verification certificates coming from the highest authorities can be copied or recreated. For this reason when authorities need to verify somebody and reissue a passport, they will ask for supporting identification, but they also ask for two references from fellow citizens. This seems intelligent as it is very difficult to copy or recreate the social network with which people can actively communicate and check-in with. For this reason this platform will use social-network based incentivized economy to find a rough guess of the probability that an entity is truly who they claim to be. Users will prove their PGP keys by signing a document with their private key and can gradually build up his credibility on the network. Credibility doesn't necessarily indicate a degree of trustworthiness, but instead represents whether the network thinks you are who you say you are. If we can get nodes to verify a browser-based PGP key, we can sign and encrypt data to allow users to share data in a secure and private way. Using one-way hashes, we can leave encrypted information on IPFS and allow the users to have a trusted person reproduce this hash. This opens up an opportunity for an innovation in online identity, where a user's data can be proven without being shared, increasing both security and privacy. This type of platform allows for a [Self-Sovereign-Identity](http://www.coindesk.com/path-self-sovereign-identity/). There are two main hurdles to creating a self-sovereign-identity. How can we quantify the credibility of an entity and how do we know that the data truly belongs to them? To solve these issues we will implement an incentivized credibility-based economy. Credibility is defined as the probability that you are a real entity and that you are able to vouch for other entities you know are real. Data is defined as anything you use to tell the world who you are. Data can be bought and sold, whereas credibility is assumed to be scarce and cannot be sold.  A user requires credibility to store data, but also requires proof-of-data to gain credibility. Through these mechanisms we hope to build a platform that can supply users with simpler and more secure online verification process. 

## Economy of Credibility
The economy of credibility operates through financial gambles on another users' identity, creating a proof-of-trust in this person. Each user is required to gamble a percentage (or minimum amount) of their credibility on themselves. In this way, nodes will lose credibility when a majority of users are gambling against them. 
![Credibility](https://github.com/kyledewy/BlockchainVerify/blob/master/charts/credibilitymarket.png)
This gamble will hold a financial reward if the majority of nodes agree with the users' bet, whether it's yes or no. In this way there will be financial incentive to both verify your friends, and find nodes who don't indicate future credibility.  We refer to these users as nodes because each node may be a single entity of any type, such as a corporation, a group of people, or bot in the form of a smart contract. Although much of this platform is designed to reduce bots, I think it may be valuable to allow bots as long as they are properly identified as such. People may produce effective bots that are programmed to do positive things for the network, and as long as they are properly identified, they may be considered credible bots by the network. It's unclear what economic role bots would play, if they're allowed, since it's problematic to have them reinforcing particular users. Perhaps bots could be allowed, but only are allowed to vote "no" on other nodes.
![Credibility Payout](https://github.com/kyledewy/BlockchainVerify/blob/master/charts/credibilitypayout.png) Each round a node is required to gamble "yes" on themselves, which they will earn back if the majority of nodes agree that you are credible. A problem with this approach is that when a node achieves 100% "yes" votes, the supporters will not receive any profits, since there is no one voting "no" and subsequently paying the winners. A solution is required for this problem as there remains no incentive to vote "yes" on somebody that has nobody voting "no". It's a small problem however, because reinforcing a node which already has 100% "yes" majority, may not pay off immediately, but your securing a safe bet incase of future attacks. The economics of this indicate that controversial nodes will be more profitable. The biggest payout a node can gain is to win a market with 51% of votes. This maximizes the amount of Credibility earned, but is inherently more risky. 


## Innovation
The proliferation of consensus ledgers combined with public key encryption allows us to build identity systems that improve on privacy, security, validity, which brings with it a solution to the trust issues associated with current online identification protocols. Zsnarks, developed by the team and Zcash, allows for interesting proofs, in which a user doesn't have to share private information to prove it. This proof system is often referred to as [Zero-Knowledge-Proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof). ![Zero-Knowledge-Proof](https://github.com/kyledewy/BlockchainVerify/blob/master/charts/zeroknowledge.png) This simple picture shows the basic concepts involved in these proofs, which is a recursive prediction/result sequence, where users can verify private information without revealing this information. 


## Identity
Current approaches to verification usually involves asking a user to sign in using one of our giant social media networks and provide a password. Why social media is such a key area in identity and verification is the fact that any physical characteristic about you can be copied. Not that physical identifiers are useless in verification, but the things about you that are very difficult to reproduce are your complex relationships and things contained in your head (passwords). Social networks tell the world who you are and who you interact with. There is a growing distrust in giving corporate entities complete control over users' identity. Most online companies offer free service in exchange for the financial rights to your data. The main problem with this approach is lack of control on the users part to determine who gets to see what. Current progress being made on  will create an identity system that can perform verification procedures without sacrificing personal information.  By utilizing public key cryptography we can move towards an encrypted online reality, that offers permission-based-access to sensitive information. The most verified data citizens receive is from the highest authority of their national government. (Doctor verifies birth certificate, Insurance company verifies drivers license etc...).  At the current stage of online identity we have the issue of fragmentation which may be in part to peoples justifiable reluctance to hand over full control of their identity. With the communication standards steadily developing in the blockchain world, I believe identity platforms will be able to communicate with eachother, to help verify users and develop a seamless online identity, that is simple, private and malleable. 


## Data Economy
The identity economy is the marketplace in which users may decide to sell whatever data they choose to. The sale must originate from that user, and they can dictate the price. This will create a free market of data, involving advertisers and users. As crypto currency begins to grow advertisers will be increasingly interested in the spending habits of users, and users will be able to charge the appropriate price. Current models tend to offer a free service and then sell the data that is derived from users using the service. What could develop in the blockchain world is that services will tend to charge micro payments depending on how much of the service you would like to use. ie. Augur, Oraclize, Storj. Advertisers are left with a different landscape. Instead of a central service keeping track of it's users, there are going to be many services that can link activities to a public key (instead of cookie). The identity economy will be based around two tokenized-markets. Credibility and Data, which are not necessarily related but require one another. In this system credibility will be how much money your own personal identity market is making, which is defined as the profit margin between people gambling "yes" on the validity of your identity and the people gambling "no" on the validity of your identity. Your data will be everything you use to let the online world know who you are. There may be situations where a node is credible but is claiming anothers persons data to be their own.

## Proof of Data

## Disputes
A data dispute will create a market where users actively communicate with both parties and attempt to validate them, through gambling. 
![Disputes](https://github.com/kyledewy/BlockchainVerify/blob/master/charts/disputes.png)
Three outcomes can come from this. Either node 1 gets claim on data, node 2 gets claim on data, or neither has valid claim on the data which will subsequently erase the data from the network. This is a complex game theory problem that needs to be reviewed intensively. 


## Market Periods
Credibility market payouts will be seperated by intervals, in which nodes are given enough time to make any changes to their gambles as necessary. The program would naturally leave everyone's bets as they are between payment rounds. The user must switch their gambles if it is not working out for them. 

## Security 
The main problem with running an incentivized and decentralized service is the game theory problems that can open up. An obvious weakpoint is the ability for someone to create thousands of nodes and subsequently create a self-reinforcing ring of nodes that all verify eachother. This attack however, would cost a lot of money to start up and would rest on a very fragile foundation, since this credibility-network isn't diverse and can fall in a domino effect as the reinforcing nodes get discovered. Security against this attack would naturally be users who are looking for obvious collusion networks. As this platform grows so does the security, but so does the ambitions for cheating. 

## Lost Passwords
If access to the Ethereum wallet is lost, this platform would implement a very simple procedure for getting this node a new public-key, which is to have that person create a dispute market for their old identity. This user would create a new account, and file a dispute against their previous node. They will win this dispute, since the old node will have no way to plea a case. The user can also message his friends and get them to vote for his new account. Some kind of proof should be available when your talking to your friends. 


## Problems To Be Solved
It will be vital for a new node on the network to sign up with a very credible node to avoid being gambled against by the network. The smart contracts could be coded, to allow for a multi-sig node that can do direct verification, such as encrypting drivers license numbers, proof of address or any of the typical centralized verification approaches. With token-incentivization, decentralization is an efficient way of delegating power and offers higher security, however, it is a difficult approach when the network is small. Crowdsourced economies work better when the crowd is large (ie. Wikipedia, Stack Exchange). For this reason it may be smart to have a pre-programmed centralized aspect that fades over time, as a way to transition into a fully decentralized identity platform.
