	Trust tokens

	The platform aims to verify the identity of a user using the public key available through a browser based Ethereum node. The public key acts much like a traditional browser cookie that remains on the users computer as a stable identifier across browsing sessions. The cookie however has no practical capabilities in public key cryptography, which is where the Ethereum public key becomes incredibly useful. This identifier acts as a code that other users of this system can encrypt pieces of data with. When data is hashed with this public key, the only person that will be able to view this data is the person in charge of the node, being the person who has the private key + password. Using a public key based browser cookie allows us to not only recongize an entity across browser sessions, but it also opens up fan opportunity for data verification and social network verification. As this field innovates, the blockchain economies will be able to utilize a protocol that not only redundantly stores data on a consensus ledger, but they will be able to store data on this blockchain and have complete control on who gets to see this data. This opens up an opportunity for an innovation in online identity, where a user's data can be proven without being shared, increasing security and privacy. The eventual implications of such a system is the user is put in charge of their identity and the financial aspects of the data that is associated with it. This creates two main problems, how do we know this entity has credibility in the identity claims they make? This platforms hopes to solve this using two economies: a credibility based economy, and a data based economy. Credibility is defined as the proability that you are a real entity and that you are able to recognize other real entities. Data is everything you use to tell the world who you are. 

	 we can encrypt users data and create a token-based economy of trust. The economy of trust involves placing a financial gamble on another users identity as proof of verification. This gamble will hold a financial reward if the majority of nodes agree with the users' bet. In this way there will be financial incentive to both verify your friends who you know are real, and find nodes who don't have a solid identity behind them. With this design we hope to put the user in complete control of their identity and data. This is often referred to as self-sovereign-identity. The user can simultaneously stay private and have a public online identity. We refer to these users as nodes because each node may be a large organization or single corporate entity. At the current stage of online identity we have the issue of fragmentation which may be in part to peoples reluctance to give a single identity full financial and personal control over their identity. Cryptography solves this problem and as we see crypto companies start up to solve the problem, we appear to run into the same issue of fragmentation as the free market tries to fill this void for a solid online identity system. We see this as a minor hiccup though as communication and interaction with other companies is no different than a regular user, since many of these companies will be built using the same platform, Ethereum. As other blockchain platforms increase their database of identities, they become a very profitable node on our network and would have to decidedly avoid the profit that comes with the large amount of trust a public intity has. Credibility being the main financial incentive of this platform. Especially entities involved in verificiation. The highest levels of verificaiton are handed out by the largest authority, being our own national governments. (Doctor verifies birth certificate, ICBC verifies license etc...). We anticipate other platforms will create a system where they verify government ID and encrypt it with the users public key as a proveable ownership of the drivers license, creating an essential bridge between governmental authority and online identity, where users don't have to compromise privacy or security. To encourage cooperation between blockchain identity platforms, and avoid the frustrations of fragmented digital identity, the platform could allow users to create crowdfunding for smart-contracts to be written, bridging identities between platforms. Thanks to the rapid innovation in encryption technologies, a platform such as this will be able to allow users to choose which entity is allowed to see which data, Having full control over their digital identities, unless the network decides they aren't real, or that a certain piece of data doesn't actualy belong to this.(Zero Knowledge Proofs). 

 	The network economy will be based around two concepts. Credibility and Data, which are not necessarily related but require one another. In this system credibility will be how much money your own personal identity market is making, which is defined as the profit margin between people gambling "yes" on the validity of your identity and the people gambling "no" on the validity of your identity. Your data will be everything you use to let the online world know who you are. There may be situations where a node is credible but is claiming anothers persons data to be their own. A data dispute will create a market where users actively communicate to both parties and try to validate them. Three outcomes can come from this. Either node 1 gets claim on data, node 2 gets claim on data, or neither has valid claim on the data which will subsequently erase the data from the network. This is a complex game theory problem that needs to be reviewed intensively. If another platforms smart-contract is hacked then we can assume 

	 It will be vital for a new node on the network to sign up with a very credible node to avoid being devoured by the network.
